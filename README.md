# What Makes Good Instruction Data on Fine-tuning LLMs for Code Intelligence Tasks?


This is the repository of our empirical study about instruction data.



## Dataset

We present the orginal four instrcution datasets in [data](https://github.com/gggjy123/InstructionData-/tree/main/Datas)



## Code

We present the source code of four research reqestions in [code](https://github.com/gggjy123/InstructionData-/tree/main/Code)



## Results

We show the complete results of RQ1 in [results](https://github.com/gggjy123/InstructionData-/tree/main/Results)



*We will release all constrcuted datasets after acceptation.*
