# What Makes Good Instruction Data on Fine-tuning LLMs for Code Intelligence Tasks?


This is the repository of our empirical study about instruction data.



## Dataset

We present the original four instructions datasets in [data](https://github.com/gggjy123/InstructionData-/tree/main/Datas/MathInstruct.json).



## Code

We present the source code of four research questions in [code](https://github.com/gggjy123/InstructionData-/tree/main/Code/RQ1/quality_selection.py).



## Results

We show the complete results of RQ1 in [results](https://github.com/gggjy123/InstructionData-/tree/main/Results/RQ1/RQ1_results_of_different_languages.pdf).



*We will release all constructed datasets after acceptance.*
